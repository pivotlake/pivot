//! A generic key→bytes object store — local filesystem, S3, or GCS — and nothing
//! catalog-specific. It knows how to `get`/`put`/`list`/`delete` objects and
//! turn a key into a ring-readable [`DataFile`]; the table manifest,
//! table log, and catalog build on it one layer up.
//!
//! Everything here is **synchronous** and pulls in no async runtime: local
//! access is plain `std::fs`; S3 and GCS go over [`ureq`] (blocking HTTP +
//! rustls). S3 requests are signed with `aws_sigv4::http_request::sign` — a pure
//! function we call inline (the tokio it transitively links is never driven);
//! GCS requests carry an OAuth2 bearer token. Credentials come from whoever
//! opened the store: a metastore hands them in per datastore, and [`open_store`]
//! falls back to the environment. [`StoreConnection`] exposes those resolved
//! settings to format-specific adapters without making this crate depend on
//! them. S3 falls back to unsigned anonymous requests when no credentials are
//! available. This runs off the io_uring ring on purpose: a
//! LIST isn't a range-GET the ring can serve, and it's rare and tiny (a few KB
//! per query) next to the hot column-chunk reads, which stay on the ring.
