//! Parallel **footer metadata** fetch — the table-load pipeline, run once at
//! `CREATE`/`ATTACH` (the reading pipeline scans the row groups it produces).
//! A small work-stealing dataflow with one module per stage, carrying one
//! [`FileRowGroups`] (a file's [`FileRef`] plus the row groups read from its
//! footer) per file end to end. This layer is Parquet-specific and knows nothing
//! of any table log: the owning table format joins each result with its file
//! entry afterward.
//!
//! - [`FileInjectorFactory`] (from `object_storage::file_injector`) — the source: hands
//!   out the input files.
//! - [`fetcher`] — reads each file's footer (over the io_uring ring, through the
//!   compressed cache) on whatever worker steals it, emitting one [`FileRowGroups`].
//! - [`writer`] — the terminal fan-in sink: gathers the [`FileRowGroups`] on one
//!   worker and hands them to the transaction-staging closure.
//!
//! It is consumed two ways, both over the same fetch core
//! ([`fetch_file_row_group_factories`]): [`load_file_row_groups`] collects the
//! [`FileRowGroups`] on the coordinator and returns them as a **value** (the
//! `ParquetTable::from_*` constructors, which flatten them into a table), while
//! [`create_load_and_stage_spec`] returns a `RecordBatchOperatorSpec` ending
//! in the [`writer`] sink that hands the `Vec<FileRowGroups>` to a staging closure
//! for the `CREATE TABLE` transaction.
