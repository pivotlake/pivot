//! The [`RowGroupFetcher`]: drives the column-chunk IO for in-flight row groups.
//!
//! It accepts claimed row groups ([`QueryRowGroupMetadata`]), takes the pages
//! the decompressed cache already holds for each one, and reads the rest of
//! its projected column chunks — local files via io_uring disk reads, remote
//! objects via HTTP range reads on the same ring — emitting a
//! [`RowGroupBuffer`] once a row group's last block lands. The
//! slot/routing/in-flight bookkeeping lives in the dispatch requester; this
//! type retains only the [`RowGroupRequest`] keyed by the logical request id.
//!
//! Disk and HTTP have very different latencies, so what bounds a worker's
//! claims depends on where the table's files are (see [`ClaimBound`]): a
//! fixed, small number of row groups for local files, and the worker's
//! read-ahead budget of bytes for remote ones.
