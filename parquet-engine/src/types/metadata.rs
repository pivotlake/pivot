//! Metadata types that describe Parquet row groups and their column chunks.
//!
//! These structs sit between the raw Parquet file metadata and the rest of the
//! query engine. [`RowGroupMetadata`] captures the static, file-level
//! information for a single row group (offsets, sizes, schema), while
//! [`QueryRowGroupMetadata`] augments it with per-query state such as the set
//! of row indices that survived predicate filtering. [`ColumnChunkMeta`] holds
//! the byte-level layout of an individual column chunk needed by the
//! decompressor to locate pages on disk.
