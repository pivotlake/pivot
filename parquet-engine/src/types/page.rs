//! Types representing Parquet pages as they move through the decompression
//! pipeline.
//!
//! A Parquet column chunk is made up of pages — an optional dictionary page
//! followed by one or more data pages. This module defines the structs that
//! carry page data (and associated metadata) from the IO reader through the
//! decompressor and into the decoder:
//!
//! 1. [`CompressedPage`] — raw bytes straight from disk, before decompression.
//! 2. [`DecompressedPage`] / [`DecompressedPageType`] — after decompression,
//!    classified as dictionary, data, or skipped.
//! 3. [`DataPage`] — the data-page–specific subset used by decoders.
//!
//! Each page optionally carries a [`FilterMask`] so decoders can skip rows
//! that were filtered out upstream.
