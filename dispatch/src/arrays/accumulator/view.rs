//! Accumulating a byte-view column (`Utf8View` or `BinaryView`).
//!
//! A view column is two things: 16-byte views, one per row, and the data
//! buffers the values too long to inline live in. The views always accumulate
//! into a slab of their own. Where the bytes behind them come from is decided
//! per append, by how much of the source the append takes:
//!
//! - An append taking at least [`RETAIN_SHARE_PERCENT`] of the source's rows
//!   copies no bytes. The source's data buffers join the emitted array's buffer
//!   list and each view's buffer index is rebased onto it, so the emitted array
//!   keeps that source alive. A source whose buffers are all already on the
//!   list is rebased onto the entries it has, whatever share the append takes,
//!   since referencing them again keeps nothing extra alive.
//! - A smaller append copies each value into blocks the column owns, so the
//!   emitted array names nothing of that source. Retaining a source for a few
//!   rows would pin its whole page (a decompressed page is a ring slot) for as
//!   long as the accumulation and then the emitted batch live, which under a
//!   selective filter is one pinned page per source batch for the whole scan.
//!
//! A value of up to [`INLINE_VIEW_LEN`] bytes needs neither: it lives inside its
//! own view, and both paths copy that view across as it lies.
