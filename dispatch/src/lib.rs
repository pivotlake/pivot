//! Dispatch is a crate designed for high-throughput, low-latency, never-crashing (always-running),
//! parallel data flow execution.
//!
//! The basic idea is to have a Worker per core (thread per core) which runs an event loop,
//! prioritizing local work but also capable of stealing work from sibling workers.
//! We want to enjoy both worlds - both cache locality (and in the future NUMA awareness)
//! that often eludes work-stealing libraries like tokio, while still having the parallelism of a
//! work-stealing library/library that allows parallel operation.
//!
//! Each worker is meant to run in large part "alone" on dataflows — its operations are all
//! parallelism-aware, and workers synchronize with each other only at the deepest level
//! (a running `Operator`).
//!
//! The main execution is done through sending a [`DataFlowBuilder`] to each worker. For a
//! given query, every worker receives the full dataflow (source through output), with each
//! stage able to synchronize across workers. For example, in a `Table -> Filter -> Aggregate`
//! query, each worker filters its own chunk of data and maintains a local count, then the
//! aggregate operators coordinate to produce the final result.
//!
//! To work with the dispatch library, build and execute dataflows through the `api` module.
//!
//! The architecture is partially based on the paper: <https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/morsels.pdf>.
//!
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # use arrow_array::StringViewArray;
//! # use dispatch::*;
//! # use dispatch::table_input;
//! # let dispatch = Dispatch::spin_up(1, 32, None);
//! # let dispatcher = dispatch.dispatcher();
//! # let table = Arc::new(ParquetTable::from_files(dispatcher, &["/tmp/data.parquet"], &[]).unwrap());
//! // SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE url LIKE '%google%'
//! let results = table_input(&dispatcher, &table, Projection::columns([13]), false)
//!     .filter(|| {
//!         let mut contains = Contains::new("google");
//!         move |batch: &arrow_array::RecordBatch| {
//!             let col = batch.column(0).as_any()
//!                 .downcast_ref::<StringViewArray>().unwrap();
//!             contains.run(col)
//!         }
//!     })
//!     .aggregate::<i64>(vec![AggregationSlot::new(AggregationKind::CountStar, 0, DataType::Int64)])
//!     .collect();
//! ```
//!

// Internal engine crate: a handful of public-facing items document their
// behaviour by linking to the private traits they're built on (e.g. a
// `KeyExtractor` impl links to the trait). That's intentional here — we're not
// a published API — so allow public docs to reference private items.
