//! Channels that connect operators within a worker's dataflow.
//!
//! Each pair of adjacent operators in a dataflow is connected by a channel. The upstream
//! operator writes to a [`Sender`], and the downstream operator reads from a [`Receiver`].
//! Channels are created by [`ChannelFactory`] instances during the factory build step on
//! the worker thread.
//!
//! Three channel types are provided, each with different trade-offs:
//!
//! - **[`mod@stealable`]** — Work-stealing deque. The local worker pushes/pops from its own
//!   deque (LIFO for cache locality), while idle workers can steal from peers. Used for
//!   most intermediate stages.
//!
//! - **[`mod@shared_work_queue`]** - One queue polled by every worker in a
//!   stage. Used when work should be distributed without waiting for an
//!   idle-time steal pass.
//!
//! - **[`mod@node_work_queue`]** - One shared queue per NUMA node. Messages
//!   name their target node and workers only poll their local queue.
//!
//! - **[`mpsc`]** — Multi-producer, single-consumer. Used for the final output channel
//!   (collecting results) and internally by [`return_to_worker`].
//!
//! - **[`return_to_worker`]** — Routes each message back to a specific worker based on
//!   [`WorkerIdOutput::worker_id`]. Used when a message must be processed by the same
//!   worker that owns related state (e.g. decompressed pages returning to the worker
//!   that holds the corresponding row group decoder).
