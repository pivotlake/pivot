//! Unary operators: one input channel, one output channel.
//!
//! A unary operator reads items of type `I` from its input channel, applies a
//! transform, and writes items of type `O` to its output channel. Most query stages
//! are unary: filter, project, count, order-by-limit, and group-by. The Parquet
//! decode pipeline in `catalog` (indexer, decompressor, decoder) is built from
//! these same primitives.
//!
//! # Key types
//!
//! - [`Unary<I, O>`] — The transform trait. Implementors define [`consume`](Unary::consume)
//!   (process one input item) and optionally [`finish`](Unary::finish) (emit final results
//!   after all input is drained, e.g. aggregation output).
//!
//! - [`UnaryOperator<I, O, U, R>`] — The [`Operator`] implementation that wires a
//!   [`Unary`] to a receiver and sender. Created during the factory build step on the
//!   worker thread.
//!
//! - [`UnaryFactory<I, O>`] — Trait for creating a [`Unary`] instance. Each factory is
//!   consumed once per worker to produce the unary transform for that worker.
//!
//! - [`UnaryOperatorFactory<I, O, UF, C, OP>`] — An [`OperatorFactory`](crate::api::OperatorFactory)
//!   that chains a head factory (`OP`) with a [`UnaryFactory`] (`UF`) and a
//!   [`ChannelFactory`](super::channels::ChannelFactory) (`C`). When built, it creates the
//!   channel, builds the head (passing it the channel's sender), and creates a
//!   `UnaryOperator` reading from the channel's receiver.
//!
//! # Finishing protocol
//!
//! Unary operators across workers coordinate finishing via a shared `siblings_left`
//! atomic counter. When a worker's input channel is empty, it decrements the counter.
//! Once all siblings have decremented (counter reaches zero), [`Unary::finish`] is called
//! — this is where aggregation operators (count, group-by, order-by-limit) emit their
//! final results.
//!
//! # Concrete unary transforms
//!
//! - [`FilterFactory`] — Keeps rows matching a boolean mask.
//! - [`MapFactory`] — Transforms each batch (column selection, computation).
//! - [`OrderByLimitFactory`] — Top-N sort across workers.
//! - [`GroupFactory`] — Hash-based group-by with aggregation.
