//! Parallel hash join: a radix-partitioned build phase populating a shared
//! directory + arena, and a prefetch-pipelined probe phase emitting the joined
//! rows.
//!
//! Build and probe are separate roots in one dataflow. Every probe-input root
//! is gated on a publication flag set after all build partition jobs complete,
//! then the probe reads the populated [`JoinTable`].
//!
//! Output layout: the probe-side columns listed in
//! [`JoinSpec::probe_output_indices`] (in list order) followed by the listed
//! build-side columns. The join is an equi-join whose key columns are read,
//! hashed, and compared through one of the [`JoinKey`] shapes, in one of the
//! [`JoinKind`]s below.
//!
//! A build-side outer join ([`JoinKind::BuildOuter`]) also emits every build
//! row no probe row matched, its probe columns null-filled. Which rows those
//! are is only known once every worker has stopped probing, so the probe marks
//! each matched build row in a shared flag array and the workers scan it
//! together behind a barrier ([`UnmatchedScan`]).
//!
//! A probe-side semi join ([`JoinKind::ProbeSemi`]) emits a probe row once if
//! the build side holds its key at all. Each probe row's candidates live in one
//! arena range, so the probe stops walking that range at the first key that
//! matches; nothing else about the phases changes, and no cross-worker state is
//! involved.
//!
//! A probe-side outer join ([`JoinKind::ProbeOuter`]) also emits every probe
//! row nothing matched, its build columns null-filled. A probe row's matches
//! all surface while its own batch is probed, so each worker settles its own
//! batches with no cross-worker state (see the probe module doc).
//!
//! A probe-side anti join ([`JoinKind::ProbeAnti`]) emits exactly the probe
//! rows a probe-side outer join would pad, and nothing else: it runs the same
//! miss tracking, but a matched pair only settles its probe row's fate and
//! never becomes an output row.
//!
//! A build-side anti join ([`JoinKind::BuildAnti`]) is the same inversion of
//! the build-side outer join: the flag array and unmatched scan run
//! unchanged, only the unmatched build rows reach the output, and they carry
//! no probe columns.
//!
//! A build-side semi join ([`JoinKind::BuildSemi`]) runs that same flag array
//! and scan with the polarity flipped: the scan emits the flagged build rows,
//! one output row per build row however many probe rows matched it, again as
//! build columns alone.
//!
//! A mark join ([`JoinKind::ProbeMark`]) emits every probe row with a
//! `mark` boolean column instead of filtering: TRUE on a match, FALSE on a
//! miss, NULL where SQL's three-valued `IN` cannot call the miss FALSE. It
//! classifies rows with the probe-side miss tracking and the semi join's
//! first-match exit, and emits batch-at-a-time with no accumulation.
