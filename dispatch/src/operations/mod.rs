//! Operators and channels: the parallel execution toolkit.
//!
//! This module contains everything that executes within a worker's
//! `DataFlow`:
//!
//! - **[`Operator`]** — The trait every node in a dataflow implements. An operator
//!   is a stateful object that can do CPU work, request disk IO, process IO completions,
//!   steal work from peers, and signal when it is finished.
//!
//! - **[`channels`]** — Sender/receiver pairs that connect adjacent operators in a
//!   dataflow. Three flavors: work-stealing (default), mpsc (final output), and
//!   return-to-worker (worker-affinity routing).
//!
//! - **[`nullary`]** — Source-like operators with no input channel that can emit
//!   output or perform side effects directly.
//!
//! - **[`unary`]** — The [`UnaryOperator`], which reads from one
//!   input channel and writes to one output channel, applying a [`Unary`]
//!   transform. Most query stages (filter, project, count, etc.) are built as unary
//!   operators. The [`UnaryOperatorFactory`] creates them during the factory build step
//!
//! # Operator lifecycle
//!
//! Operators are created during the factory build step on the worker thread (not before —
//! some hold `Rc` or other non-`Send` state). Once created, the worker's event loop
//! repeatedly calls:
//!
//! 1. [`run_cpu_work`](Operator::run_cpu_work) — does one unit of CPU work and
//!    may append logical requests to its [`OperatorIO`].
//!    Returns [`WorkStatus::Ran`] if it did anything, [`WorkStatus::Pending`] if no work was available
//!    to do.
//!
//! 2. The worker drains every node's `OperatorIO`, resolves logical reads through
//!    the decompressed and compressed caches, allocates missing extents, and
//!    submits the resulting physical IO. It delivers complete logical reads via
//!    [`process_read_response`](Operator::process_read_response); write and upload
//!    completions retain their transport-specific callbacks.
//!
//! 3. [`try_finish`](Operator::try_finish) — called when the input channel is drained
//!    and all sibling operators (across workers) have also drained. The operator does
//!    any final work (e.g. emit aggregation results) and returns `true` when fully done.
//!
//! 4. [`try_steal_work`](Operator::try_steal_work) — called when the worker is
//!    idle. The operator attempts to steal from a peer worker's input channel.
