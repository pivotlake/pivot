//! A [`RecordBatchOperatorSpec`] represents a parallel operator running over Arrow
//! [`RecordBatch`]es. A dataflow is built with it in a "fluent API" style — start
//! with `table_input`, chain operations, and call [`.collect()`](RecordBatchOperatorSpec::collect)
//! to execute:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # use arrow_array::{RecordBatch, StringViewArray};
//! # use dispatch::*;
//! # use dispatch::table_input;
//! # let table = Arc::new(ParquetTable::from_files(dispatcher, &["/tmp/data.parquet"], &[]).unwrap());
//! # let dispatch = Dispatch::spin_up(1, 32, None);
//! # let dispatcher = dispatch.dispatcher();
//! // SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE url LIKE '%google%'
//! let results = table_input(&dispatcher, &table, Projection::columns([0]), false)
//!     .filter(|| {
//!         let mut contains = Contains::new("google");
//!         move |batch: RecordBatch| {
//!             let col = batch.column(0).as_any()
//!                 .downcast_ref::<StringViewArray>().unwrap();
//!             let mask = contains.run(col);
//!             filter_record_batch(&batch, &mask).unwrap()
//!         }
//!     })
//!     .aggregate::<i64>(vec![AggregationSlot::new(AggregationKind::CountStar, 0, DataType::Int64)])
//!     .collect();
//! ```
//!
//! Operations like [`.filter()`](RecordBatchOperatorSpec::filter) and
//! [`.project()`](RecordBatchOperatorSpec::project) take a **builder closure**
//! (`Fn() -> F`) that is called once per worker thread, so each worker gets its own
//! independent operator instance with private mutable state — no synchronization needed.
//!
//! Nothing executes until [`.collect()`](RecordBatchOperatorSpec::collect) is called.
//! At that point the spec is shipped to worker threads, built into operator chains,
//! and run in parallel. Results are collected into `Vec<RecordBatch>`.
//!
//! # Internals
//!
//! Factories are stored as `Box<dyn OperatorFactory<RecordBatch>>` — an object-safe trait
//! that wraps the generic [`OperatorFactory<O>`]. This keeps the return type of every
//! chained method as plain `RecordBatchOperatorSpec`, rather than deeply nested generics.
//! See [`OperatorFactory`] and [`operator_spec`](super::operator_spec) for
//! details on why this split exists.
