//! Per-core worker threads that execute dataflows.
//!
//! Each worker is pinned to a CPU core and runs an event loop that:
//! - Receives [`DataFlowBuilder`]s from the [`Dispatch`](crate::Dispatch) via a channel
//! - Builds them into [`DataFlow`]s (creating operators, channels, etc. on the worker thread)
//! - Drives execution by interleaving CPU work, IO, and work stealing
//!
//! Workers are the execution backbone of the system. A query built with
//! [`RecordBatchOperatorSpec`](crate::api::RecordBatchOperatorSpec)
//! doesn't run until [`.collect()`](crate::api::RecordBatchOperatorSpec::collect)
//! sends one `DataFlowBuilder` to each worker. The worker then:
//!
//! 1. Calls [`DataFlowBuilder::build`] to construct the operator chain — this happens
//!    here because some resources (`Rc<Worker<T>>`, thread-local buffers) are not `Send`
//!    and must be created on the thread that uses them.
//! 2. Runs the resulting `DataFlow` through its event loop, which prioritizes keeping IO
//!    saturated (to hide disk latency), then runs CPU work, then attempts to steal work
//!    from sibling workers when idle.
//!
//! Workers coordinate with each other only at the operator level — e.g. a `Count` operator
//! uses shared atomics so the last worker to finish can emit the total. The worker itself
//! has no direct knowledge of other workers; synchronization is encapsulated in the
//! operators.
