//! HTTP(S) range reads backed by an optional on-disk cache.
//!
//! Every remote read becomes one [`RequestedRead`], satisfied by one or more
//! pieces and completed once every piece has landed:
//!
//! * With a [`DiskCache`], the requested run is split against what's on disk -
//!   resident pieces are read from the local cache file, holes are fetched over
//!   HTTP and written back.
//! * With no cache, it's a single piece fetched from the network.
//!
//! The original request is held by its [`RequestedRead`] and handed back
//! unchanged once the last piece lands, so the operator sees exactly the request
//! it submitted regardless of how it was satisfied.
//!
//! Like [`HttpEngine`], this is **ring-less**: the owning [`IORequester`] lends
//! it the worker's shared [`IOBackend`] (and the disk-op id counter) at submit
//! and drain time, so cache-file reads and write-backs ride the same per-core
//! io_uring as fs reads and HTTP sockets. The requester drains that ring and
//! routes each completion back here.
