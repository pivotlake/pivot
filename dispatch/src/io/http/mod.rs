//! HTTP(S) reads as part of the per-core io_uring, driven by
//! [`IORequester`](super::IORequester).
//!
//! Reads of [`Remote`](super::OpenFile::Remote) cache regions are served by
//! issuing HTTP `Range` requests whose body lands directly in the pinned cache
//! slot — exactly like a disk read, just over TLS instead of `pread`. The
//! transport ([`HttpEngine`]) is ring-less: on Linux it submits its socket SQEs
//! onto the *same* per-core io_uring the file reads use (see [`backend`]); on
//! other platforms it falls back to synchronous `std::net` + rustls.
//!
//! Unlike a disk read (one SQE → one CQE), an HTTPS range request is a multi-step
//! exchange (connect → TLS handshake → request → response). That state machine,
//! plus per-host keep-alive pooling, lives in [`backend`]; the requester only
//! tracks which dataflow each in-flight request belongs to and commits the block
//! once its body has fully landed.
