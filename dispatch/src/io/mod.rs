//! I/O subsystem.
//!
//! We use direct I/O (bypassing the kernel page cache) for a few reasons:
//!
//! 1. We need to distinguish real disk reads from memory-satisfied reads.
//!    Our execution engine pipelines IO and CPU work: while the disk is
//!    serving the next batch of pages, workers process already-resident data.
//!    If a "read" silently hits the page cache and returns instantly, the
//!    scheduler sees it as completed IO and eagerly submits more, flooding
//!    the pipeline with new record batches instead of letting workers drain
//!    the ones already in flight (hot in cache).
//!
//! 2. We want explicit control over memory residency and eviction policy,
//!    rather than competing with the OS for the same physical pages.
//!
//! Provides direct I/O reads with platform-specific backends (io_uring on Linux,
//! a blocking pread/pwrite thread pool on other Unix), reading straight into the
//! file cache's 4 KB-aligned slot regions.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`IORequester`] — submits and completes read requests on behalf of dataflows.
//! - [`backend::IOBackend`] — platform-specific submission/completion engine.
