//! Keeping spilled buffers until their ring slots are actually needed.
//!
//! Spilling writes a buffer's rows to disk; it does not free the buffer. The
//! buffer stays resident, and its rows readable, in the [`PartitionEvictor`],
//! laid out in the same [`PartitionTree`] its slabs were allocated from. The
//! memory context reaches the evictor through the [`Evict`] handle an operator
//! registers at build time, and takes a slot only when it has none to give:
//! the first buffer, in spill order, whose writes have all landed and that no
//! merge job is reading.
//!
//! The evictor is the one holder of its buffers. The merge gets weak handles
//! to the spilled slabs ([`spilled_slabs_by_partition`]), upgrades the ones it
//! reads for as long as it reads them, and falls back to the partition file
//! for a slab whose buffer is gone, so eviction goes on through the merge
//! without the two ever having to agree on anything but a reference count.
