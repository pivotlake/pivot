//! Taking ring slots back from operators that keep buffers outside the caches.

//! The caches give slots up through the CLOCK sweep. Operators that hold ring
//! slots of their own, such as a group-by's partition buffers, are outside that
//! sweep, so each dataflow registers the operators that can give slots back in
//! a [`DataflowEvict`] with the worker's memory context. The context turns to
//! those only after both caches have swept their whole region and found every
