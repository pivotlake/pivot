//! A worker's bump pointer over the ring slot it is currently packing entries
//! of one cache into. Each worker owns one cursor per cache (see
//! [`MemoryContext::fill_cursor`](crate::memory::context::MemoryContext::fill_cursor)).
//!
//! ```text
//!   slot ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//!   │ entry │ entry │ entry │ entry │        free               │
//!   └───────────────────────┬───────┴───────────────────────────┘
//!                           next_byte
//! ```
//!
//! The slot is held as a reader pin, so entries already packed into it stay
//! readable and the evictor cannot take it while the worker keeps filling its
//! tail. Rotating to a fresh slot is the cache's job, since each cache resets
//! its own per-slot metadata first; the cursor only records where it is.
