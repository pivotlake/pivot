//! The one interface every cache presents to the evictor and the registry.
//!
//! Two types implement it: [`CompressedCache`](super::CompressedCache), which
//! holds raw file bytes, and [`Cache<V>`](super::Cache), which holds a form
//! derived from them. The evictor only ever sees `dyn RingCache`, so it can
//! reclaim a slot from whichever cache the clock says owns it without knowing
//! what the slot holds.
