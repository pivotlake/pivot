//! An [`Extent`]: a run of a file's 4 KB blocks and where it sits in a ring
//! slot, and the [`ExtentTable`] one file's extents are kept in.
//!
//! The same extent appears on two offset 4 KB-block rulers, file blocks and
//! slot blocks:
//!
//! ```text
//!   file block:   … 48   49   50   51 …    first_file_block = 48, block_count = 4
//!                    │    │    │    │
//!   slot block:     130  131  132  133 …   first_slot_block = 130   (inside slot_idx)
//! ```
//!
//! So the extent's Nth block is file block `first_file_block + N` and slot
//! block `first_slot_block + N`. An extent never spans more than one slot, and
//! a file's extents never overlap: allocation only ever covers blocks no live
//! extent already claims.
