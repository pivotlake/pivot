//! A read-only [`catalog::datastore::Datastore`] over the tables of an Iceberg
//! REST catalog.
//!
//! The catalog is the only source of table identity: namespaces are the
//! datastore's schemas (single-level namespaces only, as a Pivot schema is one
//! identifier), and a table is what the catalog last reported it to be.
//!
//! # Freshness
//!
//! The datastore holds the catalog's answer for every table: the load-table
//! response, which is the table's metadata and where it lives. That is fetched
//! whole when the datastore opens and again every refresh interval in the
//! background, the way the pivotlake datastore refreshes its own tables, so a
//! query never waits on the catalog and reads a snapshot at most one interval
//! old. A table created or committed to between refreshes is seen at the next
//! one. What is indexed is small (kilobytes per table); a table's manifests and
//! footers are read when a query binds it, through the ring's caches, and are
//! not indexed.
//!
//! A query that names a table twice loads it once, and every bind of one
//! query resolves against the same index, so a refresh landing
//! mid-query does not move a table under it.
//!
//! # Reading through the ring
//!
//! Manifest lists and manifests are read as whole objects over the io_uring
//! ring ([`object_storage::load_objects`]), so they pass through the
//! compressed cache and the disk cache exactly as data does: a restarted server
//! finds them on local disk. Data files are Parquet, read by the same engine
//! that reads every other datastore, with row-group pruning, late
//! materialization and dynamic filters. Columns are matched to each file by
//! Parquet field id, so renamed columns read correctly and a column added after
//! a file was written reads as NULL for that file.
//!
//! # Credentials
//!
//! Every table load asks the catalog to vend storage credentials
//! (`X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation: vended-credentials`). A catalog that does
//! answers with S3 keys in the table's storage properties, and the table's
//! store is opened with them; those keys are usually an STS session's,
//! short-lived, and scoped to the table, so the store is opened again at every
//! refresh from the keys the catalog vended then. A catalog that vends nothing
//! leaves the store to the factory the datastore was opened with, the
//! process's own credential policy. Only the flat `s3.*` form is read; the
//! per-prefix `storage-credentials` list is not.
//!
//! A table's files are read through one store, the bucket its metadata file
//! is in. The managed catalogs keep a table in one bucket; a table split
//! across buckets is refused rather than read through the wrong store.
//!
//! # What is refused
//!
//! A table is refused, with an error naming the reason, rather than served
//! partially or wrongly: format version 3, a snapshot that carries delete files
//! (row-level deletes are not applied), data files that are not Parquet, and a
//! column whose Iceberg type has no Pivot type.
