title: "Datastores & storage credentials"
description: Configure pivotlake datastores, Iceberg catalogs, storage credentials, and table maintenance.
---

A datastore is a named collection of schemas and tables that a server serves.
A server can serve several datastores at once, and a query can join tables
across them. Datastores are defined in the top-level `datastores` map of the
[configuration file](/docs/reference/configuration/), and the credentials they
are opened with in the `secrets` map.

## Example

```yaml
datastores:
  local:
    kind: pivotlake
    location: /var/lib/pivot/datastores/local
    default: true
  events:
    kind: pivotlake
    location: s3://example-bucket/pivot/events/
  lake:
    kind: iceberg
    uri: https://catalog.example.com/api
    warehouse: s3://example-bucket/warehouse/
    secret: lake-catalog

secrets:
  example-bucket:
    type: s3
    scope: s3://example-bucket/
    region: us-east-1
    access_key_id: replace-me
    secret_access_key: replace-me
  lake-catalog:
    type: iceberg
    credential: client-id:client-secret
```

This server serves three datastores. `local` is the default, so an
unqualified table name refers to it. `events` and the Iceberg tables in `lake`
are read with the `example-bucket` secret, and the Iceberg catalog itself is
authenticated to with `lake-catalog`.

## Datastores

Each entry under `datastores` is keyed by the datastore's name, which is how
SQL refers to it. `kind` selects the implementation:

| Kind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pivotlake` | Pivot's own read-write tables, stored as Delta Lake tables of Parquet files in a local directory or a bucket. Also accepted as `pivot`. |
| `iceberg` | The tables of an Iceberg REST catalog, read-only. |

### Default datastore

Exactly one datastore must set `default: true`. It is the current database:
unqualified table names, and statements such as `CREATE TABLE` that name no
datastore, resolve against it. Its name is free, and it need not be called
`default`. The server refuses to start when no datastore, or more than one, is
marked as the default.

### Naming tables

A table's full name is `datastore.schema.table`. An unqualified name refers
to the `main` schema of the default datastore:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM clicks;              -- local.main.clicks
SELECT count(*) FROM lake.sales.orders;   -- the orders table in the lake datastore
```

A two-part name such as `sales.orders` can name either a schema in the default
datastore or a datastore's `main` schema. Use the full three-part name when a
datastore and a schema share a name.

### pivotlake datastores

```yaml
datastores:
  events:
    kind: pivotlake
    location: s3://example-bucket/pivot/events/
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `location` | Required | Where the datastore's tables are stored. See the table below. |
| `default` | `false` | Whether this is the [default datastore](#default-datastore). |
| `compact` | `true` | Run background compaction. See [Compaction](#compaction). |
| `compact_bytes` | `64m` | The target size of a compacted file. |
| `compact_merge_bytes` | 1.3 × `compact_bytes` | How many bytes of small files trigger a merge. |
| `compact_min_files` | `100` | How many small files may trigger a merge even below `compact_merge_bytes`. |
| `compact_parallelism` | `1` | How many merges run at once. |
| `vacuum` | `true` | Run background vacuum. See [Vacuum](#vacuum). |

The storage backend is chosen from the location's scheme:

| Location | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| `/var/lib/pivot/datastores/local`, `./data` | Local directory. A relative path is resolved against the server's working directory. |
| `file:///var/lib/pivot/datastores/local` | Local directory. |
| `s3://bucket/prefix/`, `s3a://bucket/prefix/` | Amazon S3 or an S3-compatible service. |
| `gs://bucket/prefix/` | Google Cloud Storage. |

A local directory is created if it does not exist, and only one process at a
time can open it. A location with any other scheme is a startup error.

### Iceberg datastores

```yaml
datastores:
  lake:
    kind: iceberg
    uri: https://catalog.example.com/api
    warehouse: s3://example-bucket/warehouse/
    secret: lake-catalog
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | Required | The Iceberg REST catalog's base URI. |
| `warehouse` | None | The warehouse to serve, for a catalog that serves several. |
| `secret` | None | The name of an [`iceberg` secret](#iceberg-catalog-secrets) to authenticate to the catalog with. Omit it for a catalog that requires no authentication. |
| `properties` | `{}` | Additional REST client properties, passed to the catalog client as written. |
| `default` | `false` | Whether this is the [default datastore](#default-datastore). |

Each catalog namespace appears as a schema, and the datastore is read-only.
Table files are read from the locations the catalog reports, using the
credentials the catalog vends, or the [storage secret](#storage-credentials)
whose scope covers the file when it vends none.

If the catalog becomes unreachable, the datastore keeps serving the tables it
last loaded and retries on the next [refresh](#refresh).

## Storage credentials

The `secrets` map holds two kinds of secret, told apart by `type`:

| Type | Authenticates to | Chosen by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `s3`, `gcs` | A bucket: a pivotlake datastore's files, an Iceberg table's files, or a Parquet file read with `read_parquet`. | The secret's [`scope`](#scopes), matched against the location being read. |
| `iceberg` | An Iceberg REST catalog. | The Iceberg datastore's `secret` key. |

An Iceberg datastore can use both kinds: an `iceberg` secret to talk to the
catalog, and `s3` or `gcs` secrets to read its tables' files when the catalog
does not vend credentials.

### S3 secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  example-bucket:
    type: s3
    scope: s3://example-bucket/
    region: us-east-1
    access_key_id: replace-me
    secret_access_key: replace-me
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Required | `s3`. |
| `access_key_id` | Required | The access key ID. |
| `secret_access_key` | Required | The secret access key. |
| `scope` | Every `s3://` location | The `s3://bucket/prefix` the secret covers. See [Scopes](#scopes). |
| `region` | Discovered from the bucket | The bucket's region. |
| `endpoint` | AWS S3 | An S3-compatible endpoint, such as `http://minio:9000`. Requests to it use path-style addressing. |

### GCS secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  analytics-gcs:
    type: gcs
    scope: gs://example-bucket/
    credentials_file: /etc/pivot/gcs-key.json
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Required | `gcs`. |
| `credentials_file` | Required | A Google service-account or authorized-user JSON key file. |
| `scope` | Every `gs://` location | The `gs://bucket/prefix` the secret covers. See [Scopes](#scopes). |

### Scopes

A secret's `scope` is a URI prefix. A location is opened with the secret whose
scope is the longest prefix of it, so a more specific secret overrides a
broader one:

```yaml
secrets:
  analytics:
    type: s3
    scope: s3://analytics/            # everything in the bucket...
    access_key_id: replace-me
    secret_access_key: replace-me
  analytics-archive:
    type: s3
    scope: s3://analytics/archive/    # ...except under archive/
    access_key_id: replace-me
    secret_access_key: replace-me
```

Scopes match whole path segments: `s3://analytics/arch` does not cover
`s3://analytics/archive/`. Trailing and doubled slashes make no difference.
A secret without a `scope` covers every location of its type.

Two secrets may not have the same scope, and a scope must use its secret's
scheme: an `s3` secret scoped to `gs://example-bucket/` is a startup error.

### Locations without a secret

When no secret covers a location:

- **S3** locations are read with anonymous, unsigned requests. This works for
  public buckets and for S3-compatible services that require no
  authentication.
- **GCS** locations use Application Default Credentials: the key file named by
  `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, then the credentials written by
  `gcloud auth application-default login`, then the identity of the Google
  Cloud instance the server runs on.

### Iceberg catalog secrets

An `iceberg` secret authenticates to an Iceberg REST catalog. It has no
scope: the Iceberg datastore names it with its `secret` key.

```yaml
secrets:
  lake-catalog:
    type: iceberg
    credential: client-id:client-secret
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Required | `iceberg`. |
| `token` | None | A bearer token sent with every catalog request. |
| `credential` | None | An OAuth2 client credential, written `client_id:client_secret`, exchanged for a token. |
| `oauth2_server_uri` | The catalog's token endpoint | The OAuth2 token endpoint, when it is not the catalog's own. |
| `oauth2_scope` | None | The OAuth2 scope to request with `credential`. |

Set exactly one of `token` and `credential`.

:::caution[Protect files that hold secrets]
S3 keys, Iceberg tokens, and Iceberg credentials are written in the file
itself. Make the configuration file and the metastore file readable only by
the user the server runs as.
:::

## Maintenance

A server keeps each pivotlake datastore up to date and tidy with three background
tasks. Iceberg datastores are only refreshed.

| Task | Runs | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Refresh](#refresh) | Every 30 seconds | `datastore_refresh_interval` in the [configuration file](/docs/reference/configuration/#instance-settings) |
| [Compaction](#compaction) | 30 seconds after the previous round finishes | `compact` and the `compact_*` keys, per datastore |
| [Vacuum](#vacuum) | Every hour | `vacuum`, per datastore |

### Refresh

Every refresh interval, each datastore reloads the tables it holds and the
files each table has committed. Commits made by this server are visible
immediately. Commits made by another process to a shared datastore, or tables
added to an Iceberg catalog, become visible at the next refresh.

### Compaction

Many small inserts leave many small Parquet files. Compaction rewrites them
into files of about `compact_bytes`, and re-sorts files whose sort-key ranges
overlap within a partition, so that queries read fewer files and skip more of
them.

A file smaller than half of `compact_bytes` is a small file. Small files are
merged once their total size reaches `compact_merge_bytes`, or earlier once
there are `compact_min_files` of them and they are close enough in size to be
worth merging.

Each merge holds its input rows in memory until its output is written. Raise
`compact_parallelism` only on a server with memory to spare.

A compaction round goes through every table until none has anything left to
merge, however long that takes, and the next round starts 30 seconds after it
finishes. Each round first reloads the table it compacts from its log, so it
sees new files as soon as they are committed, without waiting for the next
[refresh](#refresh). A table another process creates in a shared datastore is
compacted once a refresh has loaded it.

To compact a table on demand, use [`COMPACT`](/docs/reference/statements/compact/).

### Vacuum

Compaction, `DROP TABLE`, and new commits leave files that the current
version of a table no longer references. Vacuum deletes them once they are
older than the table's retention window:

| Files | Retention |
| --- | --- |
| Data files no longer referenced, including a dropped table's | 4 hours |
| Log files made redundant by a checkpoint | 24 hours |

A query that is still reading an older version of a table keeps working for
as long as that version's files are retained.

### Sharing a datastore between processes

Several servers, or a server and `pivot open` shells, can serve the same
datastore in a bucket. Each sees the others' commits at its next refresh.

:::caution[Run maintenance in one process per datastore]
Compaction and vacuum rewrite and delete files, so only one process should run
them for a given datastore. Set `compact: false` and `vacuum: false` on the
datastore in every other server. `pivot open` never runs them.
:::

A local directory cannot be shared: only one process can open it at a time.

## Configuration file and metastore file

Datastores and secrets can be defined in the configuration file, in the
[metastore file](/docs/reference/configuration/#metastore), or in both. The
server serves the entries of both files together. The same name defined in
both files is a startup error, and so is a scope claimed by two secrets across
the files.
