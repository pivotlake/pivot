//! Background compaction and layout optimization of a table's Parquet files.
//!
//! Frequent writes litter a table with small files, and scans pay per file. The
//! [`CompacterHandle`] merges them: files below half the configured target are
//! accumulated to a comfortably full output, with a file-count fallback for
//! pathological piles, while half-full files whose sort-key ranges overlap
//! heavily are rewritten into target-sized, range-ordered outputs. A row group
//! that exceeds the target remains one oversized file because row groups are
//! the smallest independently encoded unit. Each rewrite swaps its inputs into
//! the table in a single log commit.
//!
//! The compacter is **location-agnostic**: candidates come from the table's
//! manifest (paths, sizes, partition values, and stats; no directory scanning), and the merge (read,
//! upload, swap) runs through [`compact_table_files`]. A table under an `s3://`
//! database root compacts through the exact same code path as a local one.
//!
//! The swapped-out inputs are not deleted with the swap: a query that loaded the
//! prior version is still reading them, and the swap's Delta `Remove` actions
//! are their durable tombstones. The objects stay in place until the vacuum
//! sweep ages them out.
//!
//! Merging is **one dataflow** on the dispatch worker pool: the scan stages
//! decode the inputs' row groups, the encode stages repack them into full-size
//! row groups, and the upload stage writes each merged file over the shared
//! io_uring ring, the same operators an INSERT uses. The compacter's own task
//! only drives that dataflow (from a blocking thread) and, once the uploads
//! land, commits the swap.
//!
//! Crash safety comes from the table log, not from ordering tricks: a file is
//! part of the table iff the current log version lists it. The merged files are
//! uploaded, then swapped in for the inputs in one Delta commit (labelled a
//! rearrangement, not a data change); a crash before the commit leaves only
//! *orphan* objects (unlogged merged files), never a double read.
//!
//! Merging always writes into the table's own directory, so compacting a file
//! the table adopted (`with_pre_existing_parquets`, which leaves the file where its owner
//! put it) copies those rows under the database root. The adopted original is
//! dropped from the log but never deleted: it is not the table's to delete, and
//! the vacuum sweep only reclaims files under the table's own location. A table
//! that adopts a directory of small files and then compacts them therefore ends
//! up storing that data twice, once in the user's directory and once in its own.
//! That is the price of never writing into a directory the user owns.
//!
//! A [`DeltaDatastore`] owns one [`CompacterHandle`] actor. Configured timer ticks and
//! explicit `COMPACT` commands share its queue, so their rewrites never race in
//! one process. A timed round reloads each table to its latest log version;
//! commands carry the table snapshot captured by their query transaction. The
//! actor stops before the datastore's dispatch pool shuts down.
