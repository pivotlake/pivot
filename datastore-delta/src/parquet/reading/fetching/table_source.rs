//! Work-stealing source that feeds row groups into the fetching pipeline.
//!
//! [`RowGroupInjectorFactory`] pre-loads every row group from a
//! [`ParquetTable`] into one shared [`Injector`] queue per NUMA node. Each
//! worker gets its own [`RowGroupInjector`] (via [`RootChannelFactory`]) that
//! claims row groups from its node's queue on demand, wrapping them in a
//! [`RowGroupRequest`] with the target projection.
//!
//! Row groups are assigned to nodes by a stable hash of their identity (file +
//! index within the file), so the *same* row group lands on the *same* node
//! query after query. Everything a claim produces (the read into the
//! compressed cache, decompression, decode) happens on the claiming worker,
//! so sticky assignment keeps a row group's cached bytes on one node and its
//! next scan node-local. A worker whose node's queue runs dry claims from
//! other nodes' queues rather than idle (the stolen row group is still read
//! and decoded entirely on the claiming node; only its cached bytes end up
//! remote for a later query).
